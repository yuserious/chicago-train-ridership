This covers all steps of the data analysis process. These steps are ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.\n  Growing up in Chicago, I took the train to high school throughout the year. I often wished that the station platforms were enclosed because it was really cold to wait outside. They did have a few heaters on in the winter but if there were too many people those spots were already taken. If there indeed is a significant decline in the number of people using the trains during the winter, this information could be used to help make the case for enclosing stations.\n  This case study looks at how many people entered each station each day from 2001 January 1st to 2020 December 31st.\n\n##Working Hypothesis\n  I have three working hypotheses.\n  1. More people use the 'L' during the summer than during the winter.\n  2. More people commute to downtown for work than take the 'L' for leisure.\n  3. Individual stations, bus stops, or bus lines are likely to have a similar number of riders year over year with little relative movement. In other words the station that sees the most passengers is likely to be the same from year to year. Except maybe the pandemic might change the relative positions...\n\n##Stakeholders\n  The stakeholder or people who might be interested in this case study and its results are the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA), the citizens of Chicago, the government of the City of Chicago, and maybe tourists or visitors.\n  \n##Description\n  To test these hypothesis I looked at open data published by the CTA and the City of Chicago.

One of the key differences I noticed between the different graphs was the difference between the weekday ridership numbers and weekend ridership numbers. Perhaps predictably, the number of weekday riders is usually higher than weekend riders. However, some stations have a much higher daily ridership numbers during the week about 400%+ higher than they do over the weekends. Other stations have a smoother gradation between weekdays and weekends with weekdays being busier but only by about 50% to 100%. In general, the spread of the weekday numbers typically appears to be much more narrow than that of the weekend numbers. \n\n###Stadiums & Seasonality\nHowever, the Addison station had an interesting mix with the differences between summer and winter ridership being much larger than weekly variations. This is most likely due to the influence of Wrigley field games on that station's ridership patterns. Furthermore, while all of the stations typically see higher ridership in the summer, at the Addison station, this relationship is particularly pronounced. \n\n###Events & Daily Ridership Number Outliers\nSpecific local events near train stations can have an out-size impact on daily ridership numbers on specific days. For example, the Belmont station has an annual peak of daily traffic on one Sunday every year ranging from 2 to 4 times its normal daily ridership numbers. These numbers are explained by the annual gay-pride parade that is held only 2 blocks away from the station. Similar patterns can be seen at the Cermak-McCormick Place L Station which has a single weekend every year that has about double to triple the normal daily traffic on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday which is the International Manufacturing Technology Show.\n\n###Low Usage Commuter Stations\nThe Oakton-Skokie station has some interesting patterns that are a little more difficult to see on busier stations. In particular there is a much more obvious seasonal shift difference between weekday and weekend ridership. In the Oakton-Skokie Station, weekend daily ridership generally peaks in mid to late summer while weekday ridership peaks in late fall and then drops drastically during the winter. This might indicate an opportunity for a spring drive at this location to increase daily commuter ridership during the late spring and early summer months.\n\n###The Pandemic\nLast but not least, the pandemic. Wow, what a drop in ridership. What is interesting is that weekday ridership numbers remained higher than weekend ridership numbers. Furthermore, while the range tightened significantly, it appears that the ratio of weekday to weekend traffic may have held fairly steady despite the rapid and unprecedented changes in ridership volume.\n\n##Weekday Versus Weekend Ridership\nFor each station, the ratio between the average daily ridership during the weekdays will be compared to the average daily ridership on the weekends and holidays.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Group the data by station_id and day of week and output the sum total of rides.\nrides_station_day <- chrono_rides_by_station %>%\n  group_by(station_id, day_of_week) %>%\n  dplyr::summarize(daily_rides = sum(rides)) %>% \n  as.data.frame()\nView(rides_station_day)\n\n#Group the summary data to find the average by day type (A = Saturday, U = Sunday/Holiday, W = Weekday)\navg_day_type <- chrono_rides_by_station%>%\n  group_by(station_id, day_type) %>%\n  dplyr::summarize(daily_rides = sum(rides)) %>% \n  as.data.frame()\nView(avg_day_type)\n\n#Add a new column to differentiate weekends from weekdays\nweekday_vs_end <- mutate(chrono_rides_by_station, wd_vs_we = if_else(day_of_week == \"Saturday\" | day_of_week == \"Sunday\", \"weekend\", \"weekday\"))\nView(weekday_vs_end)\n\n#Group the summary data to find the average for the weekdays and the weekends                  \navg_weekday <- weekday_vs_end%>%\n  group_by(station_id, wd_vs_we) %>%\n  dplyr::summarize(daily_rides = sum(rides)) %>% \n  as.data.frame()\nView(avg_weekday)\n\n#Convert the dataframe from long to wide with rides split into two columns, one for weekends, one for weekdays\nstation_wd_and_we <- pivot_wider(avg_weekday, names_from = wd_vs_we, values_from = daily_rides)\nView(station_wd_and_we)\n\n#Do rough math to calculate the average daily riders on weekdays vs weekends (weekdays/5)/(weekends/2) There are many cases where the stations have 0 rides for many weekends that might throw off these numbers.

three working hypotheses I started out with at the beginning were:\n  1. More people use the 'L' during the summer than during the winter.\n  2. More people commute to downtown for work than take the 'L' for leisure.\n  3. Individual stations, bus stops, or bus lines are likely to have a similar number of riders year over year with little relative movement. Except maybe the pandemic might change the relative positions...\n  \n  Hypothesis 1 that more people use the 'L' during the summer than during the winter does seem to be mostly true. All of the stations see some seasonal fluctuations peaking from mid summer to late fall although the degree varies from station to station. More analysis will have to be done, but it appears that employment commutes are less effected by the seasons than leisure rides. This supports the idea that people are choosing other modes of transportation due to weather causes discomfort, although to be certain one would need to look at the total trips taken over the seasons to see if it is not just a general reduction in travel versus a shift in mode of transport.\n  \n  Hypothesis 2 that more people commute to downtown for work than take the 'L' for leisure seems to be supported by the data although there are some notable exceptions. In particular stations by major cultural, shopping, or sporting areas seem to have a more equal ratio of weekday to weekend trips although the average daily weekday trips are higher than the average daily weekend trips at all of the stations. The map of the city of Chicago shows an interesting pattern. Most of the stations that are located on feeder train lines into downtown have a ratio of around 2:1 of average weekday daily rides vs average weekend daily rides. Where it gets really interesting is downtown, where the ratio either drops closer to 1.5:1 or spikes up to 3:1 or more and only 4 stations are hovering around the 2:1 range. The other interesting finding was the stations by the airports and sports stadiums have a ratio much closer to 1:1.\n  \n  Hypothesis 3 is that individual stations, bus stops, or bus lines are likely to have a similar number of riders year over year. I didn't actually get around to analyzing this but just based on the data that I have looked over, this does seem true, with the exception of the pandemic, where I would have to do more detailed statistical analysis in order to see if the data actually supports this hypothesis.\n  \n##Act\n  Per hypothesis 1, the data suggests that there is an opportunity to increase ridership earlier in the spring and summer months. My personal recommendation would be to enclose the platforms but the cost of implementing this suggestion is most likely prohibitive.\n  Per hypothesis 2, the data suggests that there may be an opportunity to increase ridership on the weekends to make better use of existing capacity designed for the higher volume weekdays.\n  Hypothesis 3 could be tested further by looking at individual stations before and after renovations to see if renovations that improve rider experience have an effect on the number of people using the station.\n  \n##Limitations and further research needed:\n  Since this is an introductory course to R, I still have to learn how to use many of the statistical analysis and mapping tools that R has in order to evaluate the data and answer many more interesting questions. One question for additional study would be how much the alteration of schedules might impact ridership numbers. It would also be very interesting to see how housing density and commercial density impact 'L' ridership numbers. I hope to come back to this case study at some point to show changes over time and see if population density near a train station is a leading or lagging indicator for public transit usage. Furthermore, I would want to see data on other modes of transportation including but not limited to micro-mobility, pedestrian trips, and cars.\n\n##Resources\nThe following is a list of resources and where the data is coming from so that anyone looking at this can go back to the original data.\n\n###Datasets\nhttps://www.transitchicago.com/data/\nhttps://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-Ridership-Daily-Boarding-Totals/6iiy-9s97\nhttps://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-Ridership-Avg-Weekday-Bus-Stop-Boardings-in-Oc/mq3i-nnqe\nhttps://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-Ridership-L-Station-Entries-Daily-Totals/5neh-572f\nhttps://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-System-Information-List-of-L-Stops/8pix-ypme\nhttps://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-System-Information-Developer-Tool-GTFS-Data/sp6w-yusg\nhttps://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-Bus-Stops-kml/84eu-buny\nhttps://data.cityofchicago.org/Facilities-Geographic-Boundaries/Boundaries-Community-Areas-current-/cauq-8yn6\n\n###General Info\nhttps://askwonder.com/research/country-level-commuting-mode-share-giaipw40e\nhttps://www7.transportation.gov/transportation-health-tool/indicators/detail/il/msa/chicago#indicators\nhttps://mobilitydata.org/what-we-do/#GTFS\nhttps://www.transportation.gov/mission/health/public-transportation-trips-capita\nhttps://www.bts.gov/statistical-products/surveys/national-household-travel-survey-daily-travel-quick-facts\nhttps://moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index_Singapore_Singapore_%E6%96%B0%E5%8A%A0%E5%9D%A1-1678\nhttps://blog.batchgeo.com/commute-times-and-transportation/\nhttps://www.worldatlas.com/articles/countries-with-the-highest-public-transit-use.html","metadata":{}}]}
